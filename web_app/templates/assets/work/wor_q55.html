<br><button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('demo').style.display='block'" id='button1'>Show Answer</button> 
 <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').style.display='none'">Hide Answer</button> 
 <div id="demo" style="display:none"><br>
lets x men can complete the work in 100 days <br><br>

then 1 man complete the  work in 100x days <br><br>

given that due to absense of 10 workers, it was completed in 110 days.  means<br><br>

x-10 workers completed the work in 110 days <br><br>

1 man will complete the work in 110(x-10) days <br><br>

both are same because its the same work <br><br>

110(x-10) = 100x<br><br>

110x - 1100= 100x<br><br>

10x = 1100<br><br>

x = 110.
