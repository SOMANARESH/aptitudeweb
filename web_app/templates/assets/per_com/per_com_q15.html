<h2><u> Question 15 </u>:</h2>
<hr>
<p>There are 6 boxes numbered 1, 2,....6. Each box is to be filled up either with a red or a green ball in such a way that at least 1 box contains a green ball and the boxes containing green balls are consecutively numbered. The total number of ways in which this can be done is </p>

<h2> <u>Answer</u>: C </h2>
<h3>Solution: </h3>
	<p>Given that each box contain either red or green ball and at least one box can have a green ball. </p>
    <p>So there is possibility of having one green ball in one box at a time.</p>
	<p>So total combinations for all boxes = 6</p>
	<p>If we consider two boxes at a time which contain green ball in which boxes are consecutively numbered.</p>
	<p>So combinations are {1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6} = 5</p>
	<p>Similarly for three boxes combinations = {1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5, 4-5-6} = 4</p>
	<p>For four boxes = 3</p>
	<p>For Five boxes = 2</p>
	<p>For six boxes = 1</p>
	<p>So Total combinations = 6+5+4+3+2+1 = 21</p>
