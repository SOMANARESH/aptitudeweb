<h2> <u>Answer</u>:d </h2>
Given That The present age of Father is 5 times the present age of his son 

<br><br>

F = 5&times;S--->1

<br><br>

And also The age of father is 7 times the age of his son before 3 years 

<br><br>

=> (F-3) = 7&times;(S-3)

<br><br>

Substitute 1 in above equation we get

<br><br>

(5&times;S)-3 = (7&times;S)-21

<br><br>

=> 2&times;S = 18

<br><br>

then S = 9

<br><br>

Finally Fathers age is 

<br><br>

F = 5&times;S

<br><br>

= 5&times;9

<br><br>

= 45
