<h2> <u>Answer</u>:b </h2>


Let us assume that the ages of Father and his Son be <u>F</u> and <u>S</u>

<br><br>

Sum of their present ages is 36

<br><br>

i.e. S+F=36 ---> 1

<br><br>

And also given that Sons age is equal to present of his Father after Some years. 

<br><br>

So Let assume The time is X years then

<br><br>

S+X=F ---> 2

<br><br>

And sum of their ages after X years is 80

<br><br>

S+X+F+X=80

<br><br>

S+F+(2&times;X)=80

<br><br>

From 1 we get 

<br><br>

36+(2&times;X)=80

<br><br>

2&times;X=44

<br><br>

X=22

<br><br>

Substitute 2 into 1 we get

<br><br>

S+S+X=36

<br><br>

2&times;S=36-22

<br><br>

2&times;S=14

<br><br>

S=7

<br><br>

The present age of father is 

<br><br>

F=S+X

<br><br>

F=7+25

<br><br>

F=32
