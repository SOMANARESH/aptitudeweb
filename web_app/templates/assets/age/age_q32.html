<h2> <u>Answer</u>:a </h2>


Let us assume that the age of a Man and his Wife at the time of marriage be <u>M</u> and <u>W</u>

<br><br>

Given that a man was 6 years older to his wife then

<br><br>

M=W+6

<br><br>

After 12 years the Mans age <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> times that of his Wife then

<br><br>

M+12 = (<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> )&times;(W+12)

<br><br>

Substitute M in above eq. we get

<br><br>

W+6+12 =  (<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>)&times;(W+12)

<br><br>

W+18 = (<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>)&times;(W+12)

<br><br>

5&times;(W+18) = 6&times;(W+12)

<br><br>

(5&times;W)+90 = (6&times;W)+72

<br><br>

W=18

<br><br>

Wifes age at the time of marriage is 18 years
