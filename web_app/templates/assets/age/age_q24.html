<h2> <u>Answer</u>: c</h2>

Let us assume the ages of Sunil and his Father be <u>S</u> and <u>F</u>

<br><br>

Given that the Sum of ages of Sunil and his Father is 46

<br><br>

S+F=46

<br><br>

F=46-S---> 1

<br><br>

And also given that the fathers age is 4 times that of sunils age before 3 years

<br><br>

F-3=4&times;(S-3)

<br><br>

F=(4&times;S)-12+3

<br><br>

F=(4&times;S)-9

<br><br>

Substitute 1 in Above equation then 

<br><br>

46-S=(4&times;S)-9

<br><br>

55=5&times;S

<br><br>

S=11

<br><br>

F=46-S

<br><br>

F=46-11

<br><br>

F=35
