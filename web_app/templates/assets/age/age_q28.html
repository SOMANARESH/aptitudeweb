<h2> <u>Answer</u>: c</h2>

Let us assume that the ages of mohan and his father be <u>M</u> and <u>F</u>

<br><br>

Sum of their present ages is 35

<br><br>

i.e. M+F=35 ---> 1

<br><br>

And also given that Mohans age is equal to present of his Father after Some years. 

<br><br>

So Let assume The time is X years then

<br><br>

M+X=F ---> 2

<br><br>

And sum of their ages after X years is 85

<br><br>

M+X+F+X=85

<br><br>

M+F+(2&times;X)=85

<br><br>

From 1 we get 

<br><br>

35+(2&times;X)=85

<br><br>

2&times;X=50

<br><br>

X=25

<br><br>

Substitute 2 into 1 we get

<br><br>

M+M+X=35

<br><br>

2&times;M=35-25

<br><br>

2&times;M=10

<br><br>

M=5

<br><br>

The present age of father is 

<br><br>

F=M+X

<br><br>

F=5+25

<br><br>

F=30
