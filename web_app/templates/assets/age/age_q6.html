<p>
The ratio between the ages of A and B is 2:5. After 8 years, their ages will be in the ratio 1:2. What is the difference between their present ages?

<div>
	A.&nbsp;&nbsp;20 years

<div>
	B.&nbsp;&nbsp;22 years

<h2> <u>Answer</u>: c</h2>

The Ratio between present ages of A and B is 
<br><br>

A:B = 2:5<br><br>

=>B = 5&times;<sup>A</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>---> 1<br><br>

The Ratio between ages of A and B after 8 years is <br><br>

(A+8):(B+8) = 1:2<br><br>

=>2A+16 = B+8<br><br>

Substitute 1 in above eq. then we will get  <br><br>

=>2A+16 = 5&times;<sup>A</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>+8<br><br>

By simplificatiuon we will get <br><br>

=>A = 16<br><br>

=>B = 5&times;<sup>A</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub><br><br>

=>B = 5&times;<sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub><br><br>

B = 40<br><br>

The difference between the ages of A and B is 40-16<br><br>

= 24.
