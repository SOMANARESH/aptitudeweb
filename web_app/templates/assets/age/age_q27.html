<div>
	B.&nbsp;&nbsp;15 years

	
</div>

<h2> <u>Answer</u>:a </h2>

Given that the present ages of A and B are 50 and 18

<br><br>

A=50 & B=18

<br><br>

Let the required time be X years 

<br><br>

Given that As ages becomes double that of B after X years

<br><br>

Then (50+X)=2&times;(18+X)

<br><br>

50+X=36+2X

<br><br>

X=14 years

<br><br>

A will be twice of Bs age after 14 years.
