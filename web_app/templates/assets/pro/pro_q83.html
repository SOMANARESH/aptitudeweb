<h2> <u>Answer</u>:c </h2>

Let the cost price in the first case = 100<br><br>
Then profit in the first case = 20% of cost price = 20<br><br>
Selling price = 100+20=120<br><br>
Profit in the second case, on selling price of 120 = 20% of 120<br><br>
=24<br><br>
Difference between profits in two cases = 24-20 = 4<br><br>
If difference is 4, selling price = 120 (i.e. 30 times.)<br><br>
if difference is 85, selling price = 85&times; 30<br><br>
= 2550.
