<h2><u> Question </u>:12</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Points A and B are 90 km apart from each other on a highway. A car starts from A and another from B at the same time. If they go in the same direction, they meet after 9 hours and if they go in opposite directions, they meet after 9/7 hours. The speeds (in km/hr) of A and B are:

	A.&nbsp;&nbsp;25,45

<div>
	B.&nbsp;&nbsp;20,50

<div>
	D.&nbsp;&nbsp;35,65

<h2> <u>Answer</u>: c</h2>

Relative speed (when in same direction )<br><br>
= 90&divide9<br><br>
=10 km/hr<br><br>
Relative speed (when going in opposite direction) <br><br>
= 90 &divide; <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> <br><br>
=70 kmph <br><br>
Their speeds are (70-10)&divide;2 and (70+10)&divide;2<br><br>
=30 and 40 km/hr.
