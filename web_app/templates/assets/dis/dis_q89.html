<h2><u> Question </u>:89</h1>
<hr>
<p>
A and B walk around a circular path of 900 meter in circumference, starting together from the same point in the same direction. If their speeds are 150 meter per minute and 200 meter per minute respectively, after how many minutes will they be again at the starting point?

</p>


<div>
	A.&nbsp;&nbsp;4.5 minutes

	
</div>
<br>
<div>
	B.&nbsp;&nbsp;6 minutes

	
</div>
<br>
<div>
	C.&nbsp;&nbsp;15 minutes

	
</div>
<br>
			
<div>
	D.&nbsp;&nbsp;18 minutes

	
</div>
		
	

<h2> <u>Answer</u>:d </h2>

They will be together at the starting point when B (the faster one) has gained 900 meter (i.e. on round) over A.<br><br>
In 1 minute B gains (200-150) meter = 50 meter overA<br><br>
B will gain 900 meters in 900&divide;50<br><br>=18 minutes.
