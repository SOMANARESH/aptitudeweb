    A.&nbsp;&nbsp;4 hours


</div>
<br>
<div>
    B.&nbsp;&nbsp;4 hours 30 minutes


</div>
<br>
<div>
    C.&nbsp;&nbsp;4 hours 45 minutes


</div>
<br>

<div>
    D.&nbsp;&nbsp;5 hours


</div>


<h2><u>Answer</u>: c</h2>


One way walking + one way riding = 6 hours 15 minutes<br><br>
2&times; (one way walking + one way riding) = 12 hours 30 minutes<br><br>
Two ways walking time = 7 hours 45 minutes<br><br>
Two ways riding time = 12 hours 30 minutes &minus; 7 hours 45 minutes <br><br>
= 4 hours 45 minutes.
