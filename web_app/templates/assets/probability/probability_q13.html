<h2> <u>Answer</u>: b</h2>
<br><br>
Given that two dice are rolled.
<br><br>
So total outcomes = n(A) = 6<sup>2</sup> = 36
<br><br>
and given that the sum of two numbers on the two dice is less than or equal to 4.
<br><br>
So the possible sum values = {2,3,4}
<br><br>
So the total combinations = {11,12,13,21,22,31} = 6
<br><br>
But we need to find the probability that only one dice shows 2
<br><br>
So the combinations = {12,21} = 2
<br><br>
So the Probability = 2 &frasl; 6 = 1 &frasl; 3
