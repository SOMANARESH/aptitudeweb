<h2> <u>Answer</u>: A</h2>
Savings of A = (100-90)% = 10% of his salary<br><br>

Savings of B = (100-85)% = 15% of his salary<br><br>

But both savings are equal <br><br>

10% of As Salary = 15% of Bs salary <br><br>

<sup>As Salary</sup>&frasl;<sub>Bs Salary</sub> = <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub><br><br>

<sup>As Salary</sup>&frasl;<sub>Bs Salary</sub> = <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub><br><br>

As Salary = <sup>As portion</sup>&frasl;<sub>Sum of ratio</sub>&times;Total income<br><br>

As Salary = <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>&times;5000<br><br>

As Salary = 2&times;1000<br><br>

As Salary = 2000
