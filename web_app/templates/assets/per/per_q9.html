<h2><u> Question </u>:9</h1>
<hr>
<p>


38 litres of milk was poured into a tub and the tub was found to be 5% empty. To completely fill the tub, what amount of additional milk must be poured:
</p>


<div>
	A.&nbsp;&nbsp;1 liter

	
</div>
<br>
<div>
	B.&nbsp;&nbsp;2 liters 

	
</div>
<br>
<div>
	C.&nbsp;&nbsp;3 liters

	
</div>
<br>
			
<div>
	D.&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 liters

	
</div>
		
	

<h2> <u>Answer</u>: B</h2>
Given that the tub was filled by 38 litres of milk that results 5 % empty
<br><br>
i.e. 95% of tub was filled by 38 litres of milk
<br><br>
95% = 38
<br><br>
1% = <sup>38</sup>&frasl;<sub>95</sub>
<br><br>
1% = 0.4litres
<br><br>
So to fill the tub we require 5% of milk
<br><br>
i.e. 5% of milk = 5&times;0.4
<br><br>
5% of milk = 2litres.
