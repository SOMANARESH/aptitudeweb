<h2> <u>Answer</u>: D</h2>
Givwn that she spents 7% salary in mutual funds which is 2170<br><br>
7% of monthly salary = 2170 <br><br>
(<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>)&times;Total Salary = 2170
<br><br>
Total Salary = 2170&times;<sup>100</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>
<br><br>
Total Salary = 310&times;100
<br><br>
Total Salary = 31000
<br><br>
Total investment = 7%+18%+6%
<br><br>
Total investment = 31% of Salary per month
<br><br>
Total investment = (<sup>31</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>)Total salary per month
<br><br>
Total investment = (<sup>31</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>)&times;31000
<br><br>
Total investment = 31&times;310
<br><br>
Total investment = 9610
<br><br>
Total Annual investment = 12&times;9610
<br><br>
Total Annual investment = 115320
