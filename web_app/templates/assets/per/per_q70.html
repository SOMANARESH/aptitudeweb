<h2> <u>Answer</u>:c</h2>
Given that 60% of objects are coins, So remaining 40% of objects are rings.
<br><br>
And also 30% of coins are silver that means 70% of coins are gold.
<br><br>
And 40% of rings are gold.
<br><br>
Total percentage of Gold = % of gold in coins + % of gold in rings
<br><br>
Total percentage of Gold = [60% of coins &times; 70% of gold in coins] + [40% of rings &times;40% of gold in rings]
<br><br>
Total percentage of Gold = [<sup>60</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>&times;<sup>70</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>] + [<sup>40</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>&times;<sup>40</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>]
<br><br>
Total percentage of Gold 
<br><br>
= [<sup>42</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>] + [<sup>16</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>]
<br><br>
Total percentage of Gold = <sup>(42+16)</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>
<br><br>
Total percentage of Gold = <sup>58</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>
<br><br>
Total percentage of Gold = 58%
