<h2> <u>Answer</u>: B</h2>

Given that She spent 44668 and 56732 from total amount for tickets and gifts.
<br><br>
Total money spent on others = 44668+56732
<br><br>
Total money spent on others = 101400
<br><br>
Given that 22% amount kept with her i.e he spent 78% for others
<br><br>
78% of Total amount = 101400
<br><br>
(<sup>78</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>)&times;Total amount = 101400
<br><br>
Total Amount = 101400 &times;(<sup>100</sup>&frasl;<sub>78</sub>)
<br><br>
Total Amount = (<sup>10140000</sup>&frasl;<sub>78</sub>)
<br><br>
Total Amount = 130000
