 <div id="demo" style="display:none"><br>
Let the average weight of 8 persons be X
<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of weights of 8 persons)</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> = X
<br><br>
Sum of weights of 8 persons = 8X
<br><br>
Given that one persons with weight of 24 is replaced by new personsweight of Y(Assume) 
<br><br>
Then average weight increased by 2
<br><br>
Total sum of 8 persons = 8X-24+Y
<br><br>
Average weight of 8 persons including new persons weight is X+2
<br><br>
(Sum of weights of 8 persons including new persons weight)&divide;8= X+2<br><br>
Sum of weights of 8 persons including new persons weight  = 8(X+2)
<br><br>
8X-24+Y = 8X+16
<br><br>
Y = 16+24
<br><br>
Y = 40
