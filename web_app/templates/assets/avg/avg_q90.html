<hr>
<p>
    The average age of 11 players of a cricket team is decreased by 2 moths when two of them aged 17 years and 20 years
    are replaced by two new players. The average age of the new players is:


</p>


<div>
    A.&nbsp;&nbsp;17 years 1 months


</div>
<br>
<div>
    B.&nbsp;&nbsp;17 years 7 months


</div>
<br>
<div>
    C.&nbsp;&nbsp;17 years 11 months


</div>
<br>

<div>
    D.&nbsp;&nbsp;18 years 3 months


</div>


<h2><u>Answer</u>: B</h2>
Let average age of 11 players be X
<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of ages of 11 players)</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> = X
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 11 players = 11X&hyphen;&hyphen;&hyphen;>(1)
<br><br>
Given that the average gets decreased by 2months when two of them of 17 and 20 years replaced by new players age(Sum =Y)
<br><br>
Now average age becomes X-2
<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of ages of 11 players)</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> = X-2
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 9 players+Sum of ages of two new players = 11(X-2)
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 9 players+Y= 11X-22
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 9 players = 11X-22-Y&hyphen;&hyphen;&hyphen;>(2)
<br><br>
From (1) and (2)
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 11 player = 11X
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 9player+sum of ages of two players = 11X
<br><br>
11X-22-Y+(17+20)years= 11X months
<br><br>
Y = (37years)-22months
<br><br>
Y = (34years)+(3&times;12Months)-22months
<br><br>
Y = (34years)+36months-22months
<br><br>
Y = (34years)+14months
<br><br>
Average of two new players is
<br><br>
= <sup>(Sum of ages of two new players)</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
<br><br>
= <sup>((34years)+14months)</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
<br><br>
= 17Years+7months
