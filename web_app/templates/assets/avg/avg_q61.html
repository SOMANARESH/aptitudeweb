<h2> <u>Answer</u>: A</h2>
Given that the average of 6 persons is 39
<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of ages of 6 persons)</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> = 39
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 6 persons 6&times;39 = 234
<br><br>
The average age decreased by 1 when new person included in the group
<br><br>
i.e.<sup>(Sum of ages of 6 persons+new persons age)</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> = 39-1 
<br><br>
234+new persons age = 7&times;38
<br><br>
234+new persons age = 266
<br><br>
new persons age = 266-234
<br><br>
new persons age = 32
