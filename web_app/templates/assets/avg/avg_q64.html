<h2><u>Answer</u>: C</h2>
Given that Average of 10 students = 41 marks<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of 10 student marks)</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> = 41
<br><br>
Sum of 10 student marks = 410
<br><br>
Given that a new student score 63 marks and included to group
<br><br>
New average marks by 11 students is
<br><br>
= <sup>(Sum of marks by 11 students)</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>
<br><br>
= <sup>(Sum of marks by 10 students + <br> 11th student marks)</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>
<br><br>
= <sup>(410+63)</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>
<br><br>
= <sup>473</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>
<br><br>
= 43
