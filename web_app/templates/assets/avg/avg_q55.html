<div>
	B.&nbsp;&nbsp;43

<h2> <u>Answer</u>: A</h2>

Given that the average of 4 brothers is 12
<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of ages of four brothers)</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> = 12
<br><br>
Sum of ages of four brothers = 4&times;12
<br><br>
Sum of ages of four brothers = 48
<br><br>
Let us assume that the mothers age be X
<br><br>
If mother is also included then the average age of four brothers and mother is increased by 5
<br><br>
(Sum of ages of four brothers and age of mother)&divide;5 
<br><br>
= 12+5 = 17
<br><br>
48+X = 5&times;17
<br><br>
48+X = 85
<br><br>
X = 85-48
<br><br>
X = 37
