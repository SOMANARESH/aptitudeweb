<h2><u> Question </u>:20</h1>
<hr>
<p>
a, b, c, d and e are five consecutive even numbers. If the sum of a and b is 162, what is the sum of all the numbers?


</p>


<div>
	A.&nbsp;&nbsp;400

	
</div>
<br>
<div>
	B.&nbsp;&nbsp;380

	
</div>
<br>
<div>
	C.&nbsp;&nbsp;420

	
</div>
<br>
			
<div>
	D.&nbsp;&nbsp;None of these

<h2> <u>Answer</u>: C</h2>
Given that a, b, c, d and e are five consecutive even numbers
<br><br>
Then we can written them as a = 2n, b=2n+2, 
<br><br>
c=2n+4, d=2n+6, e=2n+8
<br><br>
Sum of a and b is 162
<br><br>
a+b = 162
<br><br>
2n+2n+2 = 162
<br><br>
4n+2 = 162
<br><br>
4n = 160
<br><br>
n = 40
<br><br>
So sum of all nnumbers is 
<br><br>
2n+2n+2+2n+4+2n+6+2n+8 
<br><br>
= 10n+20
<br><br>
= 10(40)+20
<br><br>
= 400+20
<br><br>
= 420
