<h2> <u>Answer</u>: B</h2>

Given the average of a man and his son is 18
<br><br>
i.e. <sup>(Sum of ages of a man and his son</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ) = 18
<br><br>
So sum of ages of a man and his son = 18&times;2 = 36
<br><br>
Given the ratio of their ages is 5:1
<br><br>
Fathers age can be calculated by
<br><br>
= Sum of their ages&times;
<br>
( <sup>Fathers fraction</sup>&frasl;<sub>Sum of fraction values</sub>)
<br><br>
= 36&times;(<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>)
<br><br>
= 30
<br><br>
So age of his son = 36-30 = 6
<br><br>
After 6 years thier ages becomes 
<br><br>
Fathers age = 30+6 = 36
<br><br>
Son age = 6+6 = 12
<br><br>
Their ratio after 6 years is 
<br><br>
= <sup>36</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub>
<br><br>

= <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>
<br><br>


= 3:1
