<h2> <u>Answer</u>: D</h2>
Given the ratio of bucks and frogs is 37:41
<br><br>
<sup>B</sup>&frasl;<sub>F</sub> = <sup>37</sup>&frasl;<sub>41</sub>
<br><br>
Given that the Average number of bucks and frogs = 156
<br><br>
We Know that Average is given by the formula
<br><br>
= <sup>(Total Sum of all quantities)</sup>&frasl;<sub> (Total No. of quantities) </sub>
<br><br>
Average number of bucks and frogs = 156
<br><br>
<sup>(Total Sum of number of bucks and frogs)</sup>&frasl;<sub>
(No.of quantities(2))</sub> 
<br><br>
= 156
<br><br>
Then Total number of bucks and frogs = 156&times;2<br><br>
Total number of bucks and frogs = 312
<br><br>
Number of frogs = Total number of bucks and frogs &times;
<br>(<sup> Frogs fraction</sup>&frasl;<sub>Sum of the fraction</sub> )
<br><br>
Number of frogs = 312 &times;<sup>41</sup>&frasl;<sub>(37+41)</sub>
<br><br>
= 312 &times;<sup>41</sup>&frasl;<sub>78</sub>
<br><br>
= 164
