<div>
	A.&nbsp;&nbsp;44 years

	
</div>
<br>
<div>
	B.&nbsp;&nbsp;52 years

	
</div>
<br>
<div>
	C.&nbsp;&nbsp;60 years

	
</div>
<br>
			
<div>
	D.&nbsp;&nbsp;68 years

<h2> <u>Answer</u>: C</h2>
Given that the average age of 6 sons is 8
<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of ages of 6 sons)</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> = 8
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 6 sons = 6&times;8
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 6 sons = 48
<br><br>
Given the average age of 6 sons with their parents is 22
<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of ages of 6 sons with their parents)</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> = 22
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 6 sons with their parents = 8&times;22
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 6 sons with their parents = 176
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 6 sons + Sum ofages of parents = 176
<br><br>
48 +Sum of ages of parents = 176
<br><br>
Sum ofAges of parents = 176-48
<br><br>
Sum of Ages of parents  = 128
<br><br>
Let us assume that mothers age be X
<br><br>
then according to problem fathers age is 8 years more than mother
<br><br>
Sum of Ages of parents = 128
<br><br>
X+X+8 = 128
<br><br>
2X = 128-8
<br><br>
X = 120/2
<br><br>
X = 60
<br><br>
Mothers age = 60
