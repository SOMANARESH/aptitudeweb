<h2> <u>Answer</u>: C</h2>
Let average weight of 30 students is X
<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of weight of 30 students)</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub> = X
<br><br>
Sum of weight of 30 students = 30X
<br><br>
Given that one students with weight of 20kg is replaced by new students weight of Y(Assume)
<br><br>
Now Sum of 30 students = 30X-20+Y
<br><br>
Average weight of 30 students after replacing is increased by 200grms = 200+0.2kg
<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of weight of 30 students after replacing)</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub> = 200.2
<br><br>
Sum of weight of 30 students after replacing = 30(X+0.2)
<br><br>
30X-20+Y = 30X+6
<br><br>
Y = 6+20
<br><br>
Y = 26
