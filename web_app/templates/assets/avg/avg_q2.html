<hr>
<p>
The average age of three boys is 24 years. If ratio of their ages is 3:4:5, then the age of the youngest boy is:


</p>


<div>
	A.&nbsp;&nbsp;6 years

	
</div>
<br>
<div>
	B.&nbsp;&nbsp;12 years

	
</div>
<br>
<div>
	C.&nbsp;&nbsp;18 years

	
</div>
<br>
			
<div>
	D.&nbsp;&nbsp;24 years

	
</div>
		
	

<h2> <u>Answer</u>: C</h2>
Given that the average age of 3 boys is 24
<br><br>
So we can write as
<br><br>
Average age of 3 boys 
<br><br>
= <sup>(Total sum of ages of 3 boys)</sup>&frasl;<br><sub>(Total number of boys(3))</sub>
<br><br>
24 = <sup>(Total sum of ages of 3 boys)</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>
<br><br>
Total Sum of ages of 3 boys = 3&times;24 years
<br><br>
Total Sum of ages of 3 boys = 72 years
<br><br>
Given that the ratio of ages of 3 boys is 3:4:5
<br><br>
So youngest boy fraction is 3
<br><br>
Age of the youngest boy = Total sum of ages of 3 boys &times;
<br><br>
( <sup>fraction of youngest boy</sup>&frasl;<sub>Sum of fraction</sub> )
<br><br>
Age of the youngest boy = 72&times;<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub>
<br><br>
= 18 years.
