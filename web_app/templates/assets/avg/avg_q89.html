The average age of 11 players of a cricket team is increased by 2 months when two of them aged 18 years and 20 years are replaced by two new players. The average age of the new player is:


</p>


<div>
	A.&nbsp;&nbsp;19 years 1 month

	
</div>
<br>
<div>
	B.&nbsp;&nbsp;19 years 9 months

	
</div>
<br>
<div>
	C.&nbsp;&nbsp;19 years 11 months

	
</div>
<br>
			
<div>
	D.&nbsp;&nbsp;19 years 5 months

	
</div>
		
	

<h2> <u>Answer</u>: C</h2>
Let average age of 11 players be X
<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of ages of 11 players)</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> = X
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 11 players = 11X--->(1)
<br><br>
Given that the average gets increased by 2months when two of them of 18 and 20 years replaced by new players age(Sum =Y)
<br><br>
Now average age becomes X+2
<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of ages of 11 players)</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> = X+2
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 9 players+Sum of ages of two new players = 11(X+2)
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 9 players+Y= 11X+22
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 9 players = 11X+22-Y--->(2)
<br><br>
From (1) and (2)
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 11 player = 11X
<br><br>
Sum of ages of 9player+sum of ages of two players = 11X
<br><br>
11X+22-Y+(18+20)years= 11X months
<br><br>
Y = (38years)+22months
<br><br>
Average of two new players is 
<br><br>
= <sup>(Sum of ages of two new players)</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
<br><br>
= <sup>((38years)+22months)</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
<br><br>
= 19Years+11months
