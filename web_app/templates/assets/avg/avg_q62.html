<h2> <u>Answer</u>: D</h2>

Given that the average of first 5 terms is 34
<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of first 5 terms)</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> = 34
<br><br>
Sum of first 5 terms = 5&times;34
<br><br>
Sum of first 5 terms = 170
<br><br>
Given that the average of oyher 5 terms is 38
<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of other 5 terms)</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> = 38
<br><br>
Sum of other 5 terms = 5&times;38
<br><br>
Sum of other 5 terms = 190
<br><br>
Given that the average of first 9 terms is 35
<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of first 9 terms)</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> = 35
<br><br>
Sum of first 9 terms = 9&times;35
<br><br>
Sum of first 9 terms = 315
<br><br>
Sum of ten terms = Sum of first 5 terms+ Sum of other 5 terms
<br><br>
Sum of first 9 terms + 10 th term = (170+190)
<br><br>
315+10th term = 360
<br><br>
10th term = 360-315
<br><br>
10th term = 45
