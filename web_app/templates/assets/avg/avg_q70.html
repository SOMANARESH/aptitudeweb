<h2> <u>Answer</u>: B</h2>
Given that Average marks of 28 students = 50 marks<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of marks of 28 students)</sup>&frasl;<sub>28</sub> = 50
<br><br>
Sum of 28 student marks = 28&times;50
<br><br>
Sum of 28 student marks = 1400--->(1)
<br><br>
Given that the average increased by 5 when 8 students left the school
<br><br>
New average of 20 student marks = 55
<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of marks of 20 students)</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> = 55
<br><br>
Sum of 20 student marks = 20&times;55
<br><br>
Sum of 20 student marks = 1100--->(2)
<br><br>
From (1)
<br><br>
Sum of marks by 28 students = Sum of marks by 20 students+Sum of marks by 8 students
<br><br>
1400 = 1100 + Sum of marks by 8 students
<br><br>
Sum of marks by 8 students = 1400-1100
<br><br>
Sum of marks by 8 students = 300
<br><br>
Now average of 8 students who left the schoo is
<br><br>
= <sup>(Sum of marks of 8 students)</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>
<br><br>
= <sup>300</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>
<br><br>
= 37.5
