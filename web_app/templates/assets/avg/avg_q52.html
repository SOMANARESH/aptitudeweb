<h2> <u>Answer</u>: B</h2>
Given that the average marks by 10 students is 45
<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of marks by 10 students)</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> = 45
<br><br>
Sum of marks by 10 students = 10&times;45
<br><br>
Sum of marks by 10 students = 450
<br><br>
Given that the average marks by 11 students is 48
<br><br>
<sup>(Sum of Sum of marks by 11 students )</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> = 48
<br><br>
Sum of marks by 11 students =11&times;48
<br><br>
Sum of marks by 10 students + 11th student marks
<br><br>
= 528
<br><br>
450+11th student marks = 528
<br><br>
11th student Marks = 528-450
<br><br>
11th student Marks  = 78
