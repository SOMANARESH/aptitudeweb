<h2><u> Question 3 </u>:</h2>
<hr>
<p>If a clock shows 4 O&CloseCurlyQuote;clock in the noon. Through how many degrees will the hour hand rotate when the clock shows 12 O&CloseCurlyQuote;clock in the night?</p>


	<div>
		A.120&deg;
	</div>
<br>
	<div>
		B.240&deg;
	</div>
<br>
	<div>
		C.60&deg;
	</div>
<br>
	<div>
		D.300&deg;
	</div>
		
	

<h2> <u>Answer</u>: B </h2>
<h3>Solution: </h3>
    <p>Given that start time is 4 O&CloseCurlyQuote;clock PM and End time is 12 O&CloseCurlyQuote;clock AM.</p>
	<p>So the difference between those two timings = 8 hours</p>
	<p>We know that, For each hour hour hand will rotate 30 degrees.</p>
	<p>So total angle by hour hand for 8 hours = 8 &times;30&deg; = 240&deg;
