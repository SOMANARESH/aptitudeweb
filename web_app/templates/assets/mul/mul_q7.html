<div>
    B.&nbsp;&nbsp;107375

</div>

<div>
    C.&nbsp;&nbsp;108385


</div>

<div>
    D.&nbsp;&nbsp;109395


</div>


<h2><u>Answer</u>: d</h2>

153 is a multiple of 9 as sum of its digits is 9 <br><br>

The result must also be a multiple of 9 <br><br>

sum of digits (other than the wrong digits )<br><br> = 1+0+3+5 = 9<br><br>

the number 10Y3Y5 is divisible by 9 (ignoring both Y)<br><br>

the number will be divisible by 9 when Y + Y is divisible by 9 <br><br>

sum of replaced digits = 4+4,7+7,8+8,9+9, or 8,14,16,18<br><br>

only 18 is divisible by 9 <br><br>

Y is to be replaced by 9 <br><br>

109395 is divisible by 153.
