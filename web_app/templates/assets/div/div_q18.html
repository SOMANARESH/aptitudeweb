<h2><u>Answer</u>: b</h2>

A number is divisible by 18, if its units digit is divisible by 2 and 9 both <br><br>

a number is divisible by 2, if its units digit is an even number <br><br>

The number to be added must be an even number so that sum of two numbers is even number <br><br>

A number is divisible by 9, if sum of its digits is divisible by 9 <br><br>

sum of digits of 15762 is 3 <br><br>

3+6 = 9 i.e. sum of digits is divisible by 9 <br><br>
