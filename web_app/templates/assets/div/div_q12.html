<h2><u>Answer</u>:b </h2>

A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by 2 and 3 <br><br>

The given number is divisible by 2 as it has an even number in the units place <br><br>

Sum of the digits of the given number is 11 or 2<br><br>

On adding 1 to it, sum of the digits will become 3 and hence divisible by 3.<br><br>

Z is replaced by 1.
