</p>


<div>
    A.&nbsp;&nbsp;5


</div>
<br>
<div>
    B.&nbsp;&nbsp;6

</div>
<br>
<div>
    C.&nbsp;&nbsp;7


</div>
<br>

<div>
    D.&nbsp;&nbsp;8


</div>


<h2><u>Answer</u>:a </h2>
Sum of digits at odd places (from left side) = 5+3+7 = 15 <br><br>

Sum of digits at even places (from left side) = 8+1+1=10 <br><br>

whatever we add to the given number, will increase the sum of digits which includes the units digit i.e. to 10.<br><br>

if we add 5 to given number difference between the sum of digits becomes 15-15 = 0.<br><br>

5 is to be added to the given number.
