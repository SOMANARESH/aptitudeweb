<div>
    A.&nbsp;&nbsp;19


</div>
<br>
<div>
    B.&nbsp;&nbsp;22


</div>
<br>
<div>
    C.&nbsp;&nbsp;7


</div>
<br>

<div>
    D.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nill


</div>


<h2><u>Answer</u>: C</h2>
There are 10 numbers up to 100 viz. 5,15,25,35&hyphen;&hyphen;&hyphen;95<br><br>
which have 5 at the units place and therefore are divisible by 5 but 25 and 75 are divisible by 25.<br><br>
The product of odd numbers up to 100 can be divided <br><br>
10+2=12 times by 5.<br><br>
And 128 = 2<sup>7</sup><br><br>
We know that 2&times;5 = 10<br><br>
i.e. product of one pair of 2 and 5 gives one zero.<br><br>
In the given question, 7 such pairs can be made.<br><br>
Total is at the end of the product are 7.<br><br>
