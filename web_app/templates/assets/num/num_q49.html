<h2> <u>Answer</u>: b</h2>
Let the two digit number be XY then it can be represented in decimal format as below
<br><br>
(10<sup>1</sup>&times;X)+(10<sup>0</sup>&times;Y)--->1
<br><br>
By Reversing the digits of the number we get YX and it can be represented in decimal form as 
<br><br>
(10<sup>1</sup>&times;Y)+(10<sup>0</sup>&times;X)--->2
<br><br>
Given that the sum of the digits of a number is 8
<br><br>
i.e. X+Y = 8
<br><br>
The difference between 1 and 2 is 18
<br><br>
i.e. (10X+Y)-(10Y+X) = 18
<br><br>
9X-9Y = 18
<br><br>
9(X-Y) = 18
<br><br>
X-Y = 2
