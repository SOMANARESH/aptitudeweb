<h2><u> Question </u>:72</h2>
<hr>
<p>

A laborer was appointed by a contractor on the condition that he would be paid 75 for each day of his work but would be fined at the rate of 15 per day for his absence, apart from losing his wages. After 20 days the contractor paid the laborer 1140. The number of days the labourer absented from the work was:

<div>
	A.&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days

	
</div>
<br>
<div>
	B.&nbsp;&nbsp;5 days

	
</div>
<br>
<div>
	C.&nbsp;&nbsp;4 days

	
</div>
<br>
			
<div>
	D.&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days

	
</div>
		
	

<h2> <u>Answer</u>: C</h2>
Wages for 20 days@ 75 per day = 1500<br><br>
Wages actually earned = 1140<br><br>
Total wages deducted for absence = 1500-1140=360<br><br>
Wages deducted for one day absence = 75+15=90<br><br>
Number of days he was absent for = 360&divide;90<br><br>=4 days.
