20 is divided in two parts in such a way that 6 times of first part when added o 4 times of second part gives 104. Find the first part.

<br>
<div>
	B.&nbsp;&nbsp;10

<div>
	D.&nbsp;&nbsp;12

<h2> <u>Answer</u>: D</h2>
Let us assume that the number of quantities in first part and second part be X and Y
<br><br>
then the total number of quantity is 20
<br><br>
X+Y = 20---> 1
<br><br>
Given that on adding 6 times of first part to 4 parts of second part we will get 104
<br><br>
6X+4Y = 104 --->2 
<br><br>
By solving 1 and 2 we get
<br><br>
2X = 24
<br><br>
X = 12
So the first part is 12
